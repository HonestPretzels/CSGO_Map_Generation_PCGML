1. Run FaceitLogScraper.py to get demo and meta data files
2. Run demoParser.go to get sequences of seconds and round win data
3. Run demo_parse_loader.py to get 30 second splits (data (num_splits, 30_seconds, 10_players, 23_data_points)), maps assigned to each split (maps (num_splits)), round winners (scores (num_splits)) for each split,
   and breakpoints that show which splits belong to which game (breakspoints (num_games, num_splits_per_round))
4. Run  splits_to_images.py to convert to full data arrays
5. Run layer_reduce.py to convert to reduced format
